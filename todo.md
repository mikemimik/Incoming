## ToDo

### Short Term
- Create resource inlet for epilogue resources
 - Reason: the declaration of them doesn't get used
 - Solution: create function to include them into a object variable?

- Comment the hell out of all the code (when I feel like it)
 - Use airbnb style guide
  - Commentted app.js

- Associations?

### Mid Term
- remove vagrant from this project
  - file are too bulky
  - use default 'development' vagrant repo
- Impliment REST for mongoose [in progress]
- Impliment sessions

### Long Term
- Impliment authentication
 - OAuth?
 - Local user db?
