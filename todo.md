## ToDo

### Short Term
- Separate seeding into two files
  - sequel seeding
    - require only one model dir
    - create models (seed-fns?)
    - associate models
  - mongodb seeding
    - require only one model dir
    - create models (seed-fns?)

- Add associations (they are found in the readme)

- Comment the hell out of all the code (when I feel like it)
 - Use airbnb style guide
  - Commentted app.js

- Create resource inlet for epilogue resources
 - Reason: the declaration of them doesn't get used
 - Solution: create function to include them into a object variable?

### Mid Term
- remove vagrant from this project
  - file are too bulky
  - use default 'development' vagrant repo
- Impliment REST for mongoose [in progress]
- Impliment sessions

### Long Term
- Impliment authentication
 - OAuth?
 - Local user db?
