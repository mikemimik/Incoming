## ToDo

### Short Term
- Tear down VM and respin
 - seed.js shouldn't work
 - `models.[model_name].[model_name].Expense` is what I think it looks like?
  - should be `models.[model_name].Expense`, not sure this is happening with the index files in each folder.

 - Use airbnb style guide
  - Commentted app.js

- Finish mongoose modules (they don't export?)
 - Associations?

- Impliment sessions

### Long Term
